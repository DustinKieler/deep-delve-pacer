# Deep Delve Pacer
**Deep Delve Pacer** is a plugin designed for players tackling extended deep delves at the Doom of Mokhaiotl. The plugin estimates the maximum deep delve level you can achieve before the 6-hour forced logout, along with your average and best completion time per deep delve for the run.

Upon completing level 9, an info box will appear that displays the estimated achievable delve level based on your average. The info box has a tooltip which displays the average and best times. The info box will disappear when leaving Doom's lair.

**Note:** While completing level 8 counts as a "deep delve" for the hiscores, Doom has less HP for levels 9+. For the purpose of this plugin, completing a deep delve means completing 9 or higher.
