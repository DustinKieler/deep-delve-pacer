# Deep Delve Pacer

<span style="color:red">**After installing or enabling the plugin, log out and back in before starting your delve.**</span>

**Deep Delve Pacer** is a plugin designed for players tackling extended deep delves at the Doom of Mokhaiotl. The plugin estimates the maximum deep delve level you can achieve before the 6-hour forced logout, along with your average and best completion time per deep delve for the run.

Upon completing level 9, an info box will appear that displays the estimated achievable delve level based on your average. The info box has a tooltip which displays the average and best times. The info box will disappear when leaving Doom's lair.

**NOTES:**
- While completing level 8 counts as a "deep delve" for the hiscores, Doom has less HP for levels 9+. For the purpose of this plugin, completing a deep delve means completing 9 or higher.
- **The time per deep delve is not just the kill time of Doom for that level.** The time for a deep delve starts when Doom dies, and runs until Doom dies on the next delve level.
- Times may have variation if you disconnect and reconnect during your delve (if you manage to survive anyway).
